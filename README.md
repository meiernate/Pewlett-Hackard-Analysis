# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Pewlett Hackard is a large company boasting several thousand employees. As baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate, Pewlett Hackard is preparing for the future. 

Use SQL to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results
These are the results from the employee database analysis:

* Count of retiring by title:
    * Seniior Engineer: 25916
    * Senior Staff: 24926 
    * Engineer: 9285
    * Staff: 7636
    * Technique Leader: 3603 
    * Assistant Engineer: 1090
    * Manager: 2 

* Count of eligible to mentor:
    * Total Employees eligible: 1549

## Summary
Addressing the two questions and two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight:

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
The total amount of employees that will be retiring during the "silver tsunami" will be 72,458.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Additional analysis is need to confirm this. It is safe to say yes if the 1549 employees eligible are spread accross multiple departments.  

### Two additional queries or tables
  1. A count of mentor eligibility by title. This will gain insight into how many internal employees can replace retiring employees. 
  2. Create a list of employees to mentor by length of current title. This may give us a broader scope of employees eligible to mentor.
